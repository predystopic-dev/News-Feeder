To work locally:
  1. Go to same directory as the cloned repository
  2. Run ``pip install virtualenv`` in terminal. 
  3. Run ``python -m virtualenv venv`` in terminal. ( This will create a virtual environment in python for containerizing your python modules )
  4. Run ``\venv\Scripts\activate`` ( This will activate the virtual environment created above )
  5. Run ``pip install django`` ( This will install django framework of python in your virtual environment, you can install your required modules here without affecting main system. You can check correctly installed modules using ``pip list`` )
  6. Keep in mind to do Step 4 whenever you reopen command line/terminal to work on project again.
